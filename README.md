## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alex, and I'm a Biochemist looking to move into biological data science.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my CS50X final project, which I'm planning to be a laboratory task manager for a small team of scientists to act as a virtual Kanban board for a quality control lab.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, Django, and C# through a combination of CS50W, CS50P, and freeCodeCamp/Microsoft Learn.
